* realfreq --> w?
* matsubara --> iw?


Changed the following:

* <<= --> <<
* retval -> read_value
* Gupf -> G_upfold
* read_symmetry_input -> convert_symmetry_input

* moved find_dc, find_mu_nonint, check_projectors, sorts_of_atoms, 
number_of_atoms to end, not to be documented.
* replaced all instances of 
exec "self.%s = mpi.bcast(self.%s)"%(it,it)
with
setattr(self,it,mpi.bcast(getattr(self,it))
* replaced long archive saves in converters by setattr construction
* removed G_upfolded_id -- looked redundant
