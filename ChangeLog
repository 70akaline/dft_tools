From version 1.2 to master:

HDF5 : 
 The lists and tuples in Python are now written by hdf_archive
 with keys as "0", "1", "2", "3", instead of "00000000", "00000001", "0000002", "0000003", ...
 This is necessary for C++ compatibility, where vector<T> is written
 in h5 as a subgroup with object named by their number, for generic T (i.e.
 not int, double, string).
 This change is backward compatible: old archive can be read by new code,
 but would break h5diff.




From version 1.0 to 1.2

C++
----

* new wrapping of boost random generators. No effect on API.



Python
----------

* New wrapper tool to glue C++ and python. Cython is gone.

gf:
 
 * transpose method now returns a NEW green function, like conjugate, etc...

tail : 

 * Suppress the possibility to save/load in h5 for a tail alone (must be part
   of a gf). [ok ?]
