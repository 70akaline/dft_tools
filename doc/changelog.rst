have consequences for your scripts and archives.

Python classes
--------------

The number of python classes in the old 0.x releases was increasing with no
clear naming convention. In TRIQS 1.0 we have unified the naming of the classes
following the `PEP naming conventions
<http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#naming-conventions>`_:

* Package and module names: lowercase with underscores
* Class names: CapWords
* Function and method arguments: lowercase with underscores
